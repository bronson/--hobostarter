Description:
    The model generator creates stubs for a new model.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument.  The model name may be given in CamelCase or under_score and
    should not be suffixed with 'Model'.

    The generator creates a model class in app/models, a test suite in test/unit, test fixtures in
    test/fixtures/singular_name.yml.

Examples:
    ./script/generate hobo_model account

        This will create an Account model:
            Model:      app/models/account.rb
            Test:       test/unit/account_test.rb
            Fixtures:   test/fixtures/accounts.yml
