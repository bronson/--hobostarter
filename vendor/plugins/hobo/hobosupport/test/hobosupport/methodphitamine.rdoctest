# HoboSupport - Methodphitamine

    >> require 'hobosupport'

## `Kernel#it` and `Kernel#its`

A nice hack from Jay Phillips, christened "Methodphitamine". The low-down is in the [original blog post][1].

    >> (1..10).select &it % 2 == 0
    => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    >> %w(a few short words).map &its.length
    => [1, 3, 5, 5]

Note that `it` and `its` are identical. They just read better in different contexts. Note that methodphitamine is also released directly by Jay (simply `gem install methodphitamine`) but it's small enough that it seemed easier to add it to HoboSupport and avoid an extra dependency. Thanks to Jay.
