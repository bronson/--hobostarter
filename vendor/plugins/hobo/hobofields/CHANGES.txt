== HoboFields 0.7.4 ==

    Fix to using the migration generator with STI

    HoboFields::Text - fix to to_html

    Ensure that the bundled rich types are only loaded on demand

    HoboFields::TextileString -- adding require 'redcloth'

    Fix for HoboFields::EnumString -- couldn't set values using
    symbols

    Adding to_html to PasswordString (returns '[password-hidden]')

    EnumString -- now defines constants on the class for each value in
    the enum
    
      Also, won't define an is_foo? method if that already exists

    Removing HoboFields::Percentage -- this is better handled as an
    application specific type
    
      For example, is a percentage an fixnum or a float? Is 101% valid
      or invalid?

    Fix to validates_virtual_field

    *Breaking Change* EnumString: Change to automatically defined
     class methods on EnumString classes
    
        It used to be that if you did EnumString.for(:foo, :baa), your
        class had methods foo, baa and the instance got methods foo?
        and baa?. There was a big problem with name clashes with other
        class methods. You now get no class methods, and the instance
        methods are called is_foo? and is_baa?.

    Rich field type fix: don't attempt to wrap booleans
