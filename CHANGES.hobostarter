TODO minor: now that noboy calls include_taglib, can we get rid of the whole
	Hobo::Controller::ClassMethods module?  Looks like it?

rapid_user_pages.dryml is now included along with the rest of rapid.
Before, Hobo would isolate it in its own controller-only namespace,
making it so it could not be overridden in application.dryml.

Applied upstream bugfix so users can change their own passwords.
